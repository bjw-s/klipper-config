# Ender 3 S1

## Modifications

Even though I am trying to keep this printer as close to stock as possible, we all know that is pretty much impossible :P

### Part cooling

I have replaced the stock part cooling fan with a GDSTIME 5015 24v blower fan. ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B08QJ5C5PS))

In order to mount this I have purchased and installed V3 of this fan system by [Zuff](https://cults3d.com/en/users/Zuff): https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/tool/air-duct-5015-ender-3-s1-pro-v3

### Hotend cooling

I have replaced the stock hotend cooling fan with a GDSTIME 5015 24v blower fan. ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B08QJ5C5PS))

In order to mount this I have purchased and installed this support plate by [Zuff](https://cults3d.com/en/users/Zuff): https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/tool/ender-3-s1-pro-4020-fan-cr-touch-no-y-offset. This has the additional benefit of removing the Y offset for the CR-Touch allowing it to reach more of the bed.
